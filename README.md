# XJTU-Digital-Imagings-Process-Project-and-Experiments

This is all codes and report for DIP homework for XJTU DIP course. It contains 6 homework and for each homework file, there is report, homework text file, used images and the codes related to the tasks.

The tasks literally covers all the topics taught in the lectures. All my codes are programmed by MATLAB, which is very convinient and powerful for DIP.
